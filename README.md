# Yay, pretty pictures!

This is a collection of programs that generate fractal type mathematical pictures.
They were written in Processing, Python mode. To run the programs, download Processing, open Processing and in the top right, you can install Python mode. You can open the .pyde files and click run to see pretty pictures.

The programs were mostly written during the summer holidays in 2015, after reading a book about Fractals. After that, I read through Wikipedia's list of fractals (it is a good list!) and tried to make the ones that I liked.

Currently I've over-commented about half of the files and haven't commented the others at all, so I've probably commented about right on average. The files that do have comments mostly have a comment at the top explaining what they are and how they work. I will try to add comments to the other files, to make them not too mysterious.

There is also a folder of some of the images generated by the programs, for people who like pretty pictures but running the programs would be too much effort.

Anyway, yay, pretty pictures. Have fun!
