# Yay, pretty pictures!

This is a collection of programs that generate fractal type mathematical pictures.
They were written in Processing, Python mode. To run the programs, download Processing, open Processing and in the top right, you can install Python mode. You can open the .pyde files and click run to see pretty pictures.

The programs were mostly written during the summer holidays in 2015, after reading a book about Fractals. After that, I read through Wikipedia's list of fractals (it is a good list!) and tried to make the ones that I liked.

I've commented all the files, although probably not that well, and sometimes I've used not great programming stuff, but it works and makes pretty pictures, so that's all good. I think.

There is also a folder of some of the images generated by the programs, for people who like pretty pictures but running the programs would be too much effort.

Anyway, yay, pretty pictures. Have fun!
